# Jepsen

Breaking distributed systems so you don't have to.

Jepsen is a Clojure library. A test is a Clojure program which uses the Jepsen
library to set up a distributed system, run a bunch of operations against that
system, and verify that the history of those operations makes sense. Jepsen has
been used to verify everything from eventually-consistent commutative databases
to linearizable coordination systems to distributed task schedulers. It can
also generate graphs of performance and availability, helping you characterize
how a system responds to different faults. See
[aphyr.com](https://aphyr.com/tags/jepsen) for examples of the sorts of
analyses you can carry out with Jepsen.

## Design overview

A Jepsen test runs as a Clojure program on a *control node*. That program uses
SSH to log into a bunch of *db nodes*, where it sets up the distributed system
you're going to test using the test's pluggable *os* and *db*.

Once the system is running, the control node spins up a set of logically
single-threaded *processes*, each with its own *client* for the distributed
system. A *generator* generates new operations for each process to perform.
Processes then apply those operations to the system using their clients. The
start and end of each operation is recorded in a *history*. While performing
operations, a special *nemesis* process introduces faults into the system--also
scheduled by the generator.

Finally, the DB and OS are torn down. Jepsen uses a *checker* to analyze the
test's history for correctness, and to generate reports, graphs, etc. The test,
history, analysis, and any supplementary results are written to the filesystem
under `store/<test-name>/<date>/` for later review. Symlinks to the latest
results are maintained at each level for convenience.


## Setting up a Jepsen environment

Your local machine needs a JVM and leiningen 2 installed. Probably want JNA for SSH auth too.

```sh
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jre-headless libjna-java
```

For your db nodes, you'll need some (I use five) debian boxes. I run debian
jessie, but some DBs don't need the latest packages so you might get away with
an older distribution, or possibly ubuntu. Each one should be accessible from
the control node via SSH. By default they're named n1, n2, n3, n4, and n5, but
that (along with SSH username, password, identity files, etc) is all definable
in your test. The account you use on those boxes needs sudo access to set up
DBs, control firewalls, etc.

Be advised that tests may mess with clocks, add apt repos, run pkill -9 on
processes, and generally break things, so you shouldn't, you know, point jepsen
at your prod machines unless you like to live dangerously, or you wrote the
test and know exactly what it's doing.

See [lxc.md](doc/lxc.md) for some of my notes on setting up LXC instances.

## Running a test

Once you've got everything set up, you should be able to run `cd aerospike;
lein test`, and it'll spit out something like

```clj
INFO  jepsen.core - Analysis invalid! (ﾉಥ益ಥ）ﾉ ┻━┻

{:valid? false,
 :counter
 {:valid? false,
  :reads
  [[190 193 194]
   [199 200 201]
   [253 255 256]
   ...}}
```

## Writing a test

If you don't know Clojure, you'll want to learn some of the basics. Try
[Clojure From the Ground
Up](https://aphyr.com/posts/301-clojure-from-the-ground-up-welcome) and
[Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/). Or you can
reimplement Jepsen's ideas in a language you *do* know. Either way's fine!

## FAQ

### JSCH auth errors

You might be hitting a jsch bug which doesn't know how to read hashed
known_hosts files. Remove all keys for the DB hosts from your `known_hosts`
file, then:

```sh
ssh-keyscan -t rsa n1 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -t rsa n2 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -t rsa n3 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -t rsa n4 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -t rsa n5 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

to add unhashed versions of each node's hostkey to your `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
