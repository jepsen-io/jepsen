######################## CrateDB Configuration File ##########################

# The default configuration offers the ability to use CrateDB right away.
# The purpose of this file is to give operators an overview of the various
# different configuration settings. To read the full documentation go to
# <https://crate.io/docs/>

# Use this file to fine-tune your CrateDB cluster. If you have any questions
# you are very welcome to contact us on our Community Channel on Slack
# <https://crate.io/docs/support/slackin/>.


################################ Quick Settings ##############################

# Recommended memory settings:
# - set the environment variable CRATE_HEAP_SIZE to half of your memory
#   (e.g. 26G, but not more than ~30G to benefit from CompressedOops).
#   Depending on the OS update '/etc/default/crate' or '/etc/sysconfig/crate'
# - disable swapping
#bootstrap.memory_lock : true

# Storage: CrateDB can utilize multiple volumes in parallel, make sure to set
# the owner to 'crate:crate'
#path.data: /path/to/data1,/path/to/data2

# Clustering: To avoid split-brain situations and data loss on recovery
#gateway.expected_nodes: 5              # Total amount of nodes
#gateway.recover_after_nodes: 3         # More than half of the nodes
#discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 2  # More than half of the nodes

# Networking: Bind to an IP address or interface other than localhost.
# Be careful! Never expose an unprotected node to the internet.
# Choose from [IP Address], _local_, _site_, _global_ or _[networkInterface]_
#network.host: _site_

# Cluster discovery: Specify the hosts which will form the CrateDB cluster
#discovery.zen.ping:
#  unicast.hosts:
#    - host1:4300
#    - host2:4300

# Enterprise features: CrateDB ships by default with all enterprise features
# enabled. Get in touch with us to get a license: https://crate.io/enterprise/
#license.enterprise: true
#license.ident:


################################# Full Settings ##############################

# The quick settings above should be sufficient for most situations.
# However, below are listed all available configuration options.

# Any element in the configuration can be replaced with environment variables
# by placing them in ${...} notation. For example:
#
#node.attr.rack: ${RACK_ENV_VAR}


############################# Enterprise Features ############################

# Setting this to `false` disables the Enterprise Edition of CrateDB.
#license.enterprise: true

# To enable or use any of the enterprise features, Crate.io must have given
# you permission to enable and use the Enterprise Edition of CrateDB (see
# https://crate.io/enterprise/) and you must have a valid Enterprise or
# Subscription Agreement with Crate.io. If you enable or use features that are
# part of the Enterprise Edition, you represent and warrant that you have a
# valid Enterprise or Subscription Agreement with Crate.io. Your use of
# features of the Enterprise Edition is governed by the terms and conditions
# of your Enterprise or Subscription Agreement with Crate.io.

#/////////////////////////// JMX Monitoring Plugin ///////////////////////////

# The JMX monitoring plugin requires that stat collection is enabled.
#stats.enabled: true

#//////////////////////// Database Administration ////////////////////////////

# To allow authenticated access to CrateDB from specific hosts, you must
# enable the host based authentication setting.
#auth.host_based.enabled: true

# Client access and authentication is then configured via the host based
# config, a map of remote client access entries. For example:
#auth:
#  host_based:
#    enabled: true
#    config:
#      0:
#        user: mike
#        address: 32.0.0.0/8
#        method: trust
#        protocol: pg
#      a:
#        user: barb
#        address: 172.16.0.0
#        protocol: pg
#      b:
#        user: crate
#        address: 32.0.0.0/8
#        method: trust
#      y:
#        user: eleven
#        protocol: pg
#      e:
#        user: dustin
#        address: 172.16.0.0
#        method: trust
#        protocol: http
#      z:
#        method: trust

# When CrateDB is started, the cluster contains one predefined superuser,
# called `crate`. To enable trust based authentication for the super user,
# `crate` must be specified in the host_based setting, as follows:
#auth:
#  host_based:
#    enabled: true
#    config:
#      0:
#        user: crate

# When trust based authentication is used, the server just takes the username
# provided by the client as is without further validation. The HTTP
# implementation takes the value of the `X-USER` request header as the
# username. Since a user is always required for trust based authentication, a
# default user (in case `X-USER` is not set) can be defined as follows:
#auth:
#  trust:
#    http_default_user: dustin

#///////////////////////// User Defined Functions ////////////////////////////

# To enable Javascript language for user defined functions, you can set it as
# follows:
#lang.js.enabled: true

# The Javascript language is an experimental feature and is not securely
# sandboxed, so it is disabled by default.

#/////////////////////////////////  SSL //////////////////////////////////////

# Enable encrypted communication for the HTTP endpoints:
#ssl.http.enabled: true

# Enable encrypted communication for the PostgreSQL wire protocol:
#ssl.psql.enabled: true

# Enable encrypted communication for the MQTT endpoints:
#ssl.ingestion.mqtt.enabled: true

# The full path to the node keystore file
#ssl.keystore_filepath: /path/to/keystore_file.jks

# The password used to decrypt the keystore_file.jks
#ssl.keystore_password: myKeyStorePasswd

# The password entered at the end of the keytool -genkey command if different
# than the keystore_password.
#ssl.keystore_key_password: myKeyStorePasswd

# Optional configuration for truststore

# The full path to the node truststore file
#ssl.truststore_filepath: /path/to/truststore_file.jks

# The password used to decrypt the truststore_file.jks
#ssl.truststore_password: myTrustStorePasswd

#/////////////////////// Ingestion Implementations ///////////////////////////

#//////// MQTT ////////
# Enable the MQTT ingestion implementation
#ingestion.mqtt.enabled: false

# Set a custom port for the mqtt implementation to connect to
#ingestion.mqtt.port: 1883

# The time of no activity after which the mqtt connection is closed
#ingestion.mqtt.timeout: 10s

################################### Cluster ##################################

# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running
# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names.
cluster.name: crate

# The graceful_stop namespace defines settings for a graceful stop
# procedure of nodes within the cluster.
#
# The minimum data availability the cluster needs to ensure when a certain
# node is shut down. By default the cluster ensures availability of primary
# shards but not replicas. Other options are "full" and "none".
#cluster.graceful_stop.min_availability: primaries
#
# The cluster may reallocate shards to ensure minimum data availabillity
# before a certain node shuts down.
#cluster.graceful_stop.reallocate: true
#
# The time to wait for the reallocation process to be finished.
#cluster.graceful_stop.timeout: 2h
#
# The force setting allows you to force a shutdown of a node when the graceful
# shutdown process runs into the cluster.graceful_stop.timeout.
#cluster.graceful_stop.force: false
#
# By default the regular stop procedure does not consider the graceful_stop
# settings, but only sending the USR2 signal to the process does.

# In most cases you want to allow all kinds of shards allocations.
#cluster.routing.allocation.enable = all
#
# However, you can limit shard allocations to certain kinds of shards,
# for example if you perform a rolling cluster upgrade.
#cluster.routing.allocation.enable = new_primaries

#################################### Node ####################################

# Node names are generated dynamically on startup, so you're relieved
# from configuring them manually. You can tie this node to a specific name:
node.name: "$NAME"

# Every node can be configured to allow or deny being eligible as the master,
# and to allow or deny to store the data.
#
# Allow this node to be eligible as a master node (enabled by default):
#node.master: true
#
# Allow this node to store data (enabled by default):
#node.data: true

# You can exploit these settings to design advanced cluster topologies.
#
# 1. You want this node to never become a master node, only to hold data.
#    This will be the "workhorse" of your cluster.
#node.master: false
#node.data: true
#
# 2. You want this node to only serve as a master: to not store any data and
#    to have free resources. This will be the "coordinator" of your cluster.
#node.master: true
#node.data: false
#
# 3. You want this node to be neither master nor data node, but
#    to act as a "search load balancer" (fetching data from nodes,
#    aggregating results, etc.)
#node.master: false
#node.data: false

# Inspect the cluster state via GUI tools
# such as CrateDB Admin [http://localhost:4200/admin/].

# A node can have generic attributes associated with it, which can later be
# used for customized shard allocation filtering, or allocation awareness.
# An attribute is a simple key value pair, similar to node.attr.key: value,
# here is an example:
#node.attr.rack: rack314

# By default, multiple nodes are not allowed to start from the same
# installation location. To allow it, set the following to a higher value:
#node.max_local_storage_nodes: 1

#################################### Table ###################################

# You can set a number of options (such as replica options, mapping
# or analyzer definitions, translog settings, ...) for tables globally,
# in this file.
#
# Note, that it makes more sense to configure table settings specifically for
# a certain table when creating it.

# Set the number of replicas (additional copies) of a table (1 by default):
#index.number_of_replicas: 1

# Set the refresh interval of a shard in milliseconds.
#index.refresh_interval: 1000

# Disable/enable read-only table.
#index.blocks.read_only: false

# Disable/enable all the read operations.
#index.blocks.read: false

# Disable/enable all the write operations.
#index.blocks.write: false

# Disables/enables the table settings modifications.
#index.blocks.metadata: false

# Set the number of operations before flushing.
#index.translog.flush_threshold_ops: unlimited

# Sets size of transaction log prior to flushing.
#index.translog.flush_threshold_size: 512mb

# Sets period of no flushing after which force flush occurs.
#index.translog.flush_threshold_period: 30m

# Disable/enable flushing.
# Recommended to use only for small periods of time
#index.translog.disable_flush: false

# Controls shard allocation for a specific table.
#index.routing.allocation.enable: all

# Controls the total number of shards (replicas and primaries) allowed to be
# allocated on a single node.
#index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node: -1

# When using local gateway a particular shard is recovered only if there can
# be allocated quorum of it’s copies in the cluster.
#index.recovery.initial_shards: quorum

#disable/enable table warming. Table warming allows to run registered queries
# to warm up the table before it is available.
#index.warmer.enabled:true

# These settings directly affect the performance of table and search
# operations in your cluster. Assuming you have enough machines to hold shards
# and replicas, the rule of thumb is:
#
# 1. Having more *shards* enhances the _indexing_ performance and allows to
#    _distribute_ a big table across machines.
# 2. Having more *replicas* enhances the _search_ performance and improves the
#    cluster _availability_.
#
# The "number_of_shards" is a one-time setting for a table.
#
# CrateDB takes care about load balancing, relocating, gathering the
# results from nodes, etc. Experiment with different settings to fine-tune
# your setup.

# Use the Table Status API (<http://localhost:4200/A/_status>) to inspect
# the table status.


#################################### Paths ###################################

# Path to directory containing configuration (this file and
# log4j2.properties):
#path.conf: /path/to/conf

# Path to directory where to store table data allocated for this node.
#path.data: /path/to/data
#
# Can optionally include more than one location, causing data to be striped
# across the locations (a la RAID 0) on a file level, favouring locations with
# most free space on creation. For example:
#path.data: /path/to/data1,/path/to/data2

# Path to log files:
#path.logs: /path/to/logs

# Path to where plugins are installed:
#path.plugins: /path/to/plugins

#path:
#  logs: /var/log/crate
#  data: /var/lib/crate

# BLOBS: Path to directory where to store blob data allocated for this node.
# By default blobs will be stored under the same path as normal data.
# A relative path value is relative to CRATE_HOME.
#blobs.path: /path/to/blobs


#################################### Plugin ##################################

# If a plugin listed here is not installed for current node, the node will not
# start.
#plugin.mandatory: mapper-attachments,lang-groovy


################################### Memory ###################################

# CrateDB performs poorly when JVM starts swapping: you should ensure that
# it _never_ swaps.
#
# Set this property to true to lock the memory:
#bootstrap.mlockall: true

# Make sure that the machine has enough memory to allocate for CrateDB,
# leaving enough memory for the operating system itself.
# You can allocate memory for CrateDB as follows:
#  - Set CRATE_MIN_MEM and CRATE_MAX_MEM environment variables
#    (We recommend to set MIN and MAX to the same value).
#  - Set CRATE_HEAP_SIZE environment varaible. This sets MIN and MAX to the
#    same value for you.
#
# You should also make sure that the CrateDB process is allowed to lock
# the memory, eg. by using `ulimit -l unlimited`.


############################## Network And HTTP ###############################

# CrateDB, by default, binds itself to the loopback addresses on the system,
# and listens on port [4200-4300] for HTTP traffic and on port [4300-4400] for
# node-to-node communication. (the range means that if the port is busy, it
# will automatically try the next port).
# Apart from IPv4 and IPv6 addresses there are some special values that can be
# used:
# _local_ Any loopback addresses on the system, for example 127.0.0.1.
# _site_ Any site-local addresses on the system, for example 192.168.0.1.
# _global_ Any globally-scoped addresses on the system, for example 8.8.8.8.
# _[networkInterface]_  Addresses of a network interface, for example _en0_.

# Set the bind address specifically (IPv4, IPv6 or special value):
#network.bind_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set the address other nodes will use to communicate with this node. If not
# set, it is automatically derived. It must point to an actual IP address.
#network.publish_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set both 'bind_host' and 'publish_host':
network.host: "$HOST"

# Set a custom port for the node to node communication (4300 by default):
transport.tcp.port: 44300

# Enable compression for all communication between nodes (disabled by
# default):
#transport.tcp.compress: true

# Set a custom port to listen for HTTP traffic:
http.port: 44200

# Set a custom allowed content length:
#http.max_content_length: 100mb

# Disable HTTP completely:
#http.enabled: false


################################### Gateway ##################################

# The gateway persists cluster meta data on disk every time the meta data
# changes. This data is stored persistently across full cluster restarts
# and recovered after nodes are started again.

# Defines the number of nodes that need to be started before any cluster
# state recovery will start.
gateway.recover_after_nodes: $MAJORITY

# Defines the time to wait before starting the recovery once the number
# of nodes defined in gateway.recover_after_nodes are started.
gateway.recover_after_time: 15s

# Defines how many nodes should be waited for until the cluster state is
# recovered immediately. The value should be equal to the number of nodes
# in the cluster.
gateway.expected_nodes: $N


############################ Recovery Throttling #############################

# These settings allow to control the process of shards allocation between
# nodes during initial recovery, replica allocation, rebalancing, or when
# adding and removing nodes.

# Set the number of concurrent recoveries happening on a node:
#
# 1. During the initial recovery
#cluster.routing.allocation.node_initial_primaries_recoveries: 4
#
# 2. During adding/removing nodes, rebalancing, etc
#cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries: 2

# Set to throttle throughput when recovering (eg. 100mb, by default
# unlimited):
#indices.recovery.max_size_per_sec: 40mb

# Set to limit the number of open concurrent streams when recovering a shard
# from a peer:
#indices.recovery.concurrent_streams: 5

# Specifies the chunk size used to copy the shard data from the source shard.
#indices.recovery.file_chunk_size: 512kb

# Specifies how many transaction log lines should be transfered between shards
# in a single request during the recovery process. Ignored if
# indices.recovery.translog_size is reached first.
#indices.recovery.translog_ops: 1000

# Specifies how much data of the transaction log should be transfered between
# shards in a single request during the recovery process.
#indices.recovery.translog_size: 512kb

# Define if transferred data should be compressed during the
# recovery process.
#indices.recovery.compress: true

# Specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be transferred during shard
# recovery per seconds. Limiting can be disabled by setting it to `0`. Higher
# values may result in higher network utilization, but also faster recovery
# process.
#indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec: 20mb

# Specifies the time to wait after an issue caused by cluster state syncing
# before retrying to recover.
#indices.recovery.retry_delay_state_sync: 500ms

# Specifies the time to wait after an issue caused by the network before
# retrying to recover.
#indices.recovery.retry_delay_network: 5s

# Specifies the interval after which idle recoveries will be failed.
indices.recovery.recovery_activity_timeout: 3s

# Specifies the timeout for internal requests made as part of the recovery.
indices.recovery.internal_action_timeout: 3s

# Specifies the timeout for internal requests made as part of the recovery
# that are expected to take a long time.
indices.recovery.internal_action_long_timeout: 6s


########################### Store Level Throttling ###########################

# Allows to throttle `merge` (or `all`) process of the store module. Options
# are: `all | merge | none`
#indices.store.throttle.type: merge

# If throttling is enabled by indices.store.throttle.type, this setting
# specifies the maximum bytes per second a store module process can operate
# with.
#indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec: 20mb


################################# Discovery ##################################

# Discovery infrastructure ensures nodes can be found within a cluster
# and a master node is elected. Unicast discovery is the default.
#
# Unicast discovery allows to explicitly control which nodes will be used
# to discover the cluster by pinging them.
discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [$UNICAST_HOSTS]
#  - host1:port
#  - host2:port
#
# If you want to debug the discovery process, you can set a logger in
# 'config/log4j2.properties' to help you doing so.

# Set to ensure a node sees M other master eligible nodes to be considered
# operational within the cluster. It's recommended to set it to a higher value
# than 1 when running more than 2 nodes in the cluster.
#
# We highly recommend to set the minimum master nodes as follows:
#   minimum_master_nodes: (N / 2) + 1 where N is the cluster size
# That will ensure a full recovery of the cluster state.
discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: $MAJORITY

# Set the time to wait for ping responses from other nodes when discovering.
# Set this option to a higher value on a slow or congested network to minimize
# discovery failures:
discovery.zen.ping_timeout: 1s

# Time a node is waiting for responses from other nodes to a published
# cluster state.
discovery.zen.publish_timeout: 3s

# Ping configuration
discovery.zen.fd.ping_timeout: 1s
discovery.zen.fd.ping_retries: 2
discovery.zen.fd.ping_interval: 1s
#discovery.zen.fd.ping_timeout: 30s
#discovery.zen.fd.ping_retries: 3
#discovery.zen.fd.ping_interval: 1s

#/////////////////////////// Discovery via DNS ///////////////////////////////

# Service discovery allows CrateDB to look up hosts for unicast discovery via
# SRV DNS records.

# To enable SRV discovery you need to set the discovery type to 'srv'.
#discovery.type: srv

# Service discovery requires a query that is used to look up SRV records,
# this is usually in the format _service._protocol.fqdn
#discovery.srv.query: _crate._srv.example.com

#////////////////////////////// EC2 Discovery ////////////////////////////////

# EC2 discovery allows CrateDB to look up hosts for unicast discovery via the
# AWS EC2 API.

# To enable EC2 discovery you need to set the discovery type to 'ec2'.
#discovery.type: ec2

# There are multiple ways to filter EC2 instances:
#
# Filter by security groups, either by id or name. Only instances with the
# given group will be used for unicast host discovery.
#discovery.ec2.groups: sg-example-1, sg-example-2
#
# Control whether all (`false`) or just any (`true`) security group must
# be present for the instance to be used for discovery.
#discovery.ec2.any_group: true
#
# Filter by availability zones. Only instances within the given availability
# zone will be used for unicast host discovery.
#discovery.ec2.availability_zones:
#  - us-east-1
#  - us-west-1
#  - us-west-2
#  - ap-southeast-1
#  - ap-southeast-2
#  - ap-northeast-1
#  - eu-west-1
#  - eu-central-1
#  - sa-east-1
#  - cn-north-1
#
# EC2 instances for discovery can also be filtered by tags using the
# `discovery.ec2.tag.` prefix plus the tag name.
# E.g. to filter instances that have the `environment` tags with the value
# `dev` your setting will look like:
#discovery.ec2.tag.environment: dev
#discovery.ec2.tag.<name>: <value>
#
# If you have your own compatible implementation of the EC2 API service you
# can set the enpoint that should be used.
#cloud.aws.ec2.endpoind: http://example.com/endpoint

#/////////////////////////////// Azure Discovery /////////////////////////////

# Azure discovery allows CrateDB to look up hosts for unicast discovery via
# the Azure API.

# To enable Azure discovery you need to set the discovery type to 'azure'.
#discovery.type: azure

# You should provide resource group name of your instances
#cloud.azure.management.resourcegroup.name: myrg

# The following configuration values must be provided for active directory
# authentication.
#cloud.azure.management.subscription.id: xxxxx.xxxx.xxx.xxx
#cloud.azure.management.tenant.id: xxxxxxxxxxx
#cloud.azure.management.app.id: xxxxxxxxxx
#cloud.azure.management.app.secret: my_password

# There are two methods of discovery. Discovery method ``vnet`` will discover
# all VMs in the same virtual network.
# The use of method ``subnet`` will add all virtual machines in the same
# subnet to the cluster.
#discovery.azure.method: vnet


############################# Routing Allocation #############################

# Allows to control shard allocation.
# Options are: `all | new_primaries`
#
# - `all` allows all shard allocations, the cluster can allocate all kinds of
#   shards.
# - `new_primaries` allows allocations for new primary shards only. This means
#   that for example a newly added node will not allocate any replicas.
#   However it is still possible to allocate new primary shards for new
#   indices. Whenever you want to perform a zero downtime upgrade of your
#   cluster you need to set this value before gracefully stopping the first
#   node and reset it to `all` after starting the last updated node.
#cluster.routing.allocation.enable: all

# Allow to control when rebalancing will happen based on the total state of
# all the indices shards in the cluster. Defaulting to `indices_all_active`
# to reduce chatter during initial recovery.
# Options are: `always | indices_primary_active | indices_all_active`
#cluster.routing.allocation.allow_rebalance: indices_all_active

# Define how many concurrent rebalancing tasks are allowed cluster wide.
#cluster.routing.allocation.cluster_concurrent_rebalance: 2

# Define the number of initial recoveries of primaries that are allowed per
# node. Since most times local gateway is used, those should be fast and we
# can handle more of those per node without creating load.
#cluster.routing.allocation.node_initial_primaries_recoveries: 4

# How many concurrent recoveries are allowed to happen on a node.
#cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries: 2


################################## Awareness #################################

# Cluster allocation awareness allows to configure shard and replicas
# allocation across generic attributes associated with nodes.

# Define node attributes which will be used to do awareness based on the
# allocation of a shard and its replicas. Shards will relocate to even the
# number of shards across the nodes, but a shard and its replica will not be
# allocated in the same `rack_id` value.
#
# The awareness attributes can hold several values
#cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes:

# Node attributes on which shard allocation will be forced.
# If you know in advance the number of values an awareness attribute
# can have and you would like to never have more replicas then needed
# allocated on a specific group of nodes with the same awareness attribute
# value. For that, we can force awareness on specific attributes.
#cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.force.<attribute>.values:


############################### Balanced Shards ##############################

# Defines the weight factor for shards allocated on a node (float).
#cluster.routing.allocation.balance.shard: 0.45f

# Defines a factor to the number of shards per index allocated on a specific
# node (float).
#cluster.routing.allocation.balance.index: 0.5f

# Defines a weight factor for the number of primaries of a specific index
# allocated on a node (float).
#cluster.routing.allocation.balance.primary: 0.05f

# Minimal optimization value of operations that should be performed (non
# negative float).
#cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold: 1.0f


####################### Cluster-Wide Allocation Filtering ####################

# Place new shards only on nodes where one of the specified values matches the
# attribute.
#cluster.routing.allocation.include.<attribute>:

# Place new shards only on nodes where none of the specified values matches
# the attribute.
#cluster.routing.allocation.exclude.<attribute>:

# used to specify a number of rules, which all MUST match for a node in order
# to allocate a shard on it.
# This is in contrast to include which will include a node if ANY rule
# matches.
#cluster.routing.allocation.require.<attribute>:


########################## Disk-based Shard Allocation #######################

# Prevent shard allocation on nodes depending on the disk usage.
#cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled: true

# Defines the lower disk threshold limit for shard allocations.
# New shards will not be allocated on nodes with disk usage greater than this
# value. It can also be set to an absolute bytes value (like e.g. `500mb`)
#cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low: 85%

# Defines the higher disk threshold limit for shard allocations.
# The cluster will attempt to relocate existing shards to another node if the
# disk usage on a node rises above this value. It can also be set to an
# absolute bytes value (like e.g. `500mb`)
#cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high: 90%


########################## Field Data Circuit Breaker #########################

# The field data circuit breaker allows estimation of needed memory required
# for loading field data into memory.

# Specifies the limit for the fielddata breaker.
#indices.fielddata.breaker.limit: 60%

# A constant that all field data estimations are multiplied with to
# determine a final estimation.
#indices.fielddata.breaker.overhead: 1.0.3


################################# Threadpools ################################

# Every node holds several thread pools to improve how threads are managed
# within a node. There are several pools, but the important ones include:
# index, search, bulk, refresh
#thread_pool.index.type: fixed
#thread_pool.index.queue_size: 200


################################## Metadata ##################################

# Defines how often the cluster collection metadata information
