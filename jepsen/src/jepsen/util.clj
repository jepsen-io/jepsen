  "Let bindings, plus early return.

  You want to do some complicated, multi-stage operation assigning lots of
  variables--but at different points in the let binding, you need to perform
  some conditional check to make sure you can proceed to the next step.
  Ordinarily, you'd intersperse let and if statements, like so:

      (let [res (network-call)]
        (if-not (:ok? res)
          :failed-network-call

          (let [people (:people (:body res))]
            (if (zero? (count people))
              :no-people

              (let [res2 (network-call-2 people)]
                ...

  This is a linear chain of operations, but we're forced to nest deeply because
  we have no early-return construct. In ruby, we might write

      res = network_call
      return :failed_network_call if not x.ok?

      people = res[:body][:people]
      return :no-people if people.empty?

      res2 = network_call_2 people
      ...

  which reads the same, but requires no nesting thanks to Ruby's early return.
  Clojure's single-return is *usually* a boon to understandability, but deep
  linear branching usually means something like

    - Deep nesting         (readability issues)
    - Function chaining    (lots of arguments for bound variables)
    - Throw/catch          (awkward exception wrappers)
    - Monadic interpreter  (slow, indirect)

  This macro lets you write:

      (letr [res    (network-call)
             _      (when-not (:ok? res) (return :failed-network-call))
             people (:people (:body res))
             _      (when (zero? (count people)) (return :no-people))
             res2   (network-call-2 people)]
        ...)

  letr works like let, but if (return x) is ever returned from a binding, letr
  returns x, and does not evaluate subsequent expressions.

  If something other than (return x) is returned from evaluating a binding,
  letr binds the corresponding variable as normal. Here, we use _ to indicate
  that we're not using the results of (when ...), but this is not mandatory.
  You cannot use a destructuring bind for a return expression.

  letr is not a *true* early return--(return x) must be a *terminal* expression
  for it to work--like (recur). For example,

      (letr [x (do (return 2) 1)]
        x)

  returns 1, not 2, because (return 2) was not the terminal expression.

  return only works within letr's bindings, not its body."

(defn named-locks
  "Creates a mutable data structure which backs a named locking mechanism.

  Named locks are helpful when you need to coordinate access to a dynamic pool
  of resources. For instance, you might want to prohibit multiple threads from
  executing a command on a remote node at once. Nodes are uniquely identified
  by a string name, so you could write:

      (defonce node-locks (named-locks))

  Now, concurrent calls to start-db! will not execute concurrently.

  The structure we use to track named locks is an atom wrapping a map, where
  the map's keys are any object, and the values are canonicalized versions of
  that same object. We use standard Java locking on the canonicalized versions.
  This is basically an arbitrary version of string interning."
