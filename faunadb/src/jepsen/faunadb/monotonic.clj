(ns jepsen.faunadb.monotonic
  "Verifies that clients observe monotonic state and timestamps when performing
  current reads, and that reads of past timestamps observe monotonic state.

  For our monotonic state, we'll use a register, implemented as an instance
  with a single value. That register will be incremented by `inc` calls,
  starting at 0.

  {:type :invoke, :f :inc, :value nil}

  which returns

  {:type :invoke, :f inc, :value [ts, v]}

  Meaning that we set the value to v at time ts.

  Meanwhile, we'll execute reads like:

  {:type :invoke, :f :read, :value [ts, nil]}

  which means we should read the register at time `ts`, returning

  {:type :ok, :f :read, :value [ts, v]}.

  If the timestamp is nil, we read at the current time, and return the
  timestamp we executed at."
