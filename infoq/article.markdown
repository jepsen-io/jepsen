[AA] We use a description of the article (up to 400 chars) in our CMS. 
The description appears beneath the article title on the website and in the newsletter.
I could use the following paragraph but it is a bit longer at 414 chars. 
Could you shorten it a bit?

Distributed systems are characterized by exchanging state over high-latency or
unreliable links--most often, via an IP network. The system must be robust to
both node and network failure if it is to operate reliably--however, not all
systems satisfy the safety invariants we'd like. In this article, we'll explore
some of the design considerations of distributed databases, and how they
respond to a network partitions.

IP networks may arbitrarily drop, delay, reorder, or duplicate messages send
between nodes--so many distributed systems use TCP to prevent reordered and
duplicate messages. However, TCP/IP is still fundamentally *asynchronous*: the
network may arbitrarily delay messages, and connections may drop at any time.
Moreover, failure detection is unreliable: it may be impossible to determine
whether a node has died, the network connection has dropped, or things are just
slower than expected.

[AA] You may want to read Eric Brewer's article: http://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed
especially the section "Why "2 of 3" is misleading". He has a more nuanced approach to CA under partitioning.

This type of failure--where messages are arbitrarily delayed or dropped--is
called a network partition. Partitions can occur in production networks for a
variety of reasons: GC pressure, NIC failure, switch firmware bugs,
misconfiguration, congestion, or backhoes, to name a few.  Given that
partitions occur, the CAP theorem restricts the maximally achievable guarantees
of distributed systems. When messages are dropped, "consistent" (CP) systems
preserve linearizability by rejecting some requests on some nodes. "Available"
(AP) systems can handle requests on all nodes, but must sacrifice
linearizability: different nodes can disagree about the order in which
operations took place. Since partition tolerance is not optional, CA systems do
not exist.

## Testing partitions

Theory bounds a design space, but real software may not achieve those bounds.
We need to *test* a system's behavior to really understand how it behaves. 

First, you'll need a collection of nodes to test. I'm using five LXC nodes on a
Linux computer, but you could use Solaris zones, VMs, EC2 nodes, physical
hardware, etc. You'll want the nodes to share a network of some kind--in my
case, a single virtual bridge interface. I've named my nodes n1, n2, ... n5,
and set up DNS between them and the host OS.

To cause a partition, you'll need a way to drop or delay messages: for
instance, with firewall rules. On Linux you can use `iptables -A INPUT -s
some-peer -j DROP` to cause a unidirectional partition, dropping messages from
some-peer to the local node. By applying these rules on several hosts, you can
build up arbitrary patterns of network loss.

Running these commands repeatably on several hosts takes a little bit of work.
I'm using a tool I wrote called Salticid, but you could use CSSH or any other
cluster automation system. The key factor is latency--you want to be able to
initiate and end the partition quickly, so Chef or other slow-converging
systems are probably less useful.

Then, you'll need to set up the distributed system on those nodes, and design
an application to test it. I've written a simple test: a Clojure program,
running outside the cluster, with threads simulating five isolated clients. The
clients concurrently add N integers to a set in the distributed system: one
writes 0, 5, 10, ...; another writes 1, 6, 11, ...; and so on. Each client
records a log of its writes, and whether they succeeded or failed. When all
writes are complete, it waits for the cluster to converge, and check whether
the client logs agree with the actual state of the database. This is a simple
kind of consistency check, but can be adapted to test a variety of data models.

The client and config automation, including scripts for simulating partitions
and setting up databases, is freely available. For instructions and code, see
http://aphyr.com/posts/281-call-me-maybe-carly-rae-jepsen-and-the-perils-of-network-partitions.

## PostgreSQL

A single-node PostgreSQL instance is a CP system; it can provide serializable
consistency for transactions, at the cost of becoming unavailable when the node
fails. However, the distributed system comprised of the server *and* a client
may not be consistent.

Postgres' commit protocol is a special case of two-phase commit. In the first
phase, the client votes to commit (or abort) the current transaction, and sends
that message to the server. The server checks to see whether its consistency
constraints allow the transaction to proceed, and if so, it votes to commit. It
writes the transaction to storage and informs the client that the commit has
taken place (or failed, as the case may be.) Now both the client and server
agree on the outcome of the transaction.

What happens if the message acknowledging the commit is dropped before the
client receives it? Then the client does't know whether the commit succeeded or
not! The 2PC protocol says nodes must wait for the acknowledgement message to
arrive in order to decide the outcome. If it doesn't arrive, 2PC fails to
terminate. It's not a partition-tolerant protocol. Real systems can't wait
forever, so at some point the client times out, leaving the commit protocol in
an indeterminate state.

If I cause this type of partition, the JDBC Postgres client throws exceptions
like

```
217 An I/O error occurred while sending to the backend. 
Failure to execute query with SQL:
INSERT INTO "set_app" ("element") VALUES (?)  ::  [219]
PSQLException:
 Message: An I/O error occured while sending to the backend.
 SQLState: 08006
 Error Code: 0
218 An I/O error occured while sending to the backend.
```

... which we might interpret as "the transactions for writes 217 and 218
failed".  However, when the test app queries the database to find which write
transactions were successful, it finds that two "failed" writes were actually
present:

```
1000 total
950 acknowledged
952 survivors
2 unacknowledged writes found! ヽ(´ー｀)ノ
(215 218)
0.95 ack rate
0.0 loss rate
0.002105263 unacknowledged but successful rate
```

Out of 1000 attempted writes, 950 were successfully acknowledged, and all
950 of those writes were present in the result set. However, two writes (215
and 218) succeeded, even though they threw an exception! Note that this
exception doesn't guarantee that the write succeeded or failed: 217 also threw
an I/O error while sending, but because the connection dropped before the
client's commit message arrived at the server, the transaction never took
place.

There is no way to reliably distinguish these cases from the client. A network
partition--and indeed, most network errors--doesn't mean a failure. It means the
*absence* of information. Without a partition-tolerant commit protocol, like
extended three-phase commit, we cannot assert the state of these writes.

You can handle this indeterminacy by making your operations idempotent and
retrying them blindly, or by writing the transaction ID as a part of the
transaction itself, and querying for it after the partition heals.

## Redis

Redis is a data structure server, typically deployed as a shared heap. Since it
runs on one single-threaded server, it offers linearizable consistency by
default: all operations happen in a single, well-defined order.

Redis also offers asynchronous primary->secondary replication. A single server
is chosen as the primary, which can accept writes. It relays its state changes
to secondary servers, which follow along. Asynchronous, in this context, means
that clients *do not block* while the primary replicates a given operation--the
write will "eventually" arrive on the secondaries.

To handle discovery, leader election, and failover, Redis includes a companion
system: Redis Sentinel. Sentinel nodes gossip the state of the Redis servers
they can see, and attempt to promote and demote nodes to maintain a single
authoritative primary.

In this test, I've installed Redis and Redis Sentinel on all five nodes.
Initially all five clients read from the primary on n1, and n2--n5 are
secondaries. Then we partition n1 and n2 away from n3, n4, and n5.

If Redis were a CP system, n1 and n2 would become unavailable during the
partition, and a new primary in the majority component (n3, n4, n5) would be
elected. This is *not* the case. Instead, writes continue to successfully
complete against n1. After a few seconds, the Sentinel nodes begin to detect
the partition, and elect, say, n5 as a new primary.

For the duration of the partition, there are *two* primary nodes--one in each
component of the system--and both accept writes independently. This is a
classic split-brain scenario--and it violates the C in CP. Writes (and reads) in
this state are not linearizable, because clients will see a different state of
the database depending on which node they’re talking to.

What happens when the partition resolves? Redis used to leave *both* primaries
running indefinitely. Any partition resulting in a promotion would cause
permanent split-brain. That changed in Redis 2.6.13, which was released April
30th, 2013.  Now, the sentinels will resolve the conflict by demoting the
original primary, destroying a potentially unbounded set of writes in the
process. For instance:

```
2000 total
1998 acknowledged
872 survivors
1126 acknowledged writes lost! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
50 51 52 53 54 55 ... 1671 1675 1676 1680 1681 1685
0.999 ack rate
0.5635636 loss rate
0.0 unacknowledged but successful rate
```

Out of 2000 writes, Redis claimed that 1998 of them completed successfully.
However, only 872 of those integers were present in the final set. Redis threw
away 56% of the writes it claimed were successful.

There are two problems here. First, notice that all the clients lost
writes at the beginning of the partition: (50, 51, 52, 53, ...). That’s because
they were all writing to n1 when the network dropped--and since n1 was demoted
later, any writes made during that window were destroyed.

The second problem was caused by split-brain: both n1 and n5 were primaries up
until the partition healed. Depending on which node they were talking to, some
clients might have their writes survive, and others have their writes lost. The
last few numbers in the set (mod 5) are all 0 and 1--corresponding to clients
which kept using n1 as a primary in the minority component.

In any replication scheme with failover, Redis provides neither high
availability nor consistency. Only use Redis as a "best-effort" cache and
shared heap where arbitrary data loss or corruption is acceptable.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a document-oriented database with a similar distribution design to
Redis. In a replica set, there exists a single primary node which accepts
writes and asynchronously replicates a log of its operations ("oplog") to N
secondaries. However, there are a few key differences from Redis.

First, Mongo builds in its leader election and replicated state machine.
There's no separate system which tries to observe a replica set in order to
make decisions about what it should do. The replica set decides among itself
which node should be primary, when to step down, how to replicate, etc. This is
operationally simpler and eliminates whole classes of topology problems.

Second, Mongo allows you to ask that the primary confirm successful replication
of a write by its disk log, or by secondary nodes. At the cost of latency, we
can get stronger guarantees about whether or not a write was successful.

To test this, I've set up a five-node replica set, with the primary on n1.
Clients make their writes to a single document (the unit of MongoDB
consistency) via compare-and-set atomic updates. I then partition n1 and n2
away from the rest of the cluster, forcing Mongo to elect a new primary on the
majority component, and to demote n1. I let the system run in a partitioned
state for a short time, then reconnect the nodes, allowing Mongo to reconverge
before the end of the test.

There are several consistency levels for operations against MongoDB, termed
"write concerns". The defaults, up until recently, were to avoid checking for
any type of failure at all. The Java driver calls this
WriteConcern.UNACKNOWLEDGED. Naturally, this approach can lose any number of
"successful" writes during a partition:

```
6000 total
5700 acknowledged
3319 survivors
2381 acknowledged writes lost! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
469 474 479 484 489 494 ... 3166 3168 3171 3173 3178 3183
0.95 ack rate
0.4177193 loss rate
0.0 unacknowledged but successful rate
```

In this trial, 42% of writes, from 469 through 3183, were thrown away.

However, WriteConcern.SAFE, which confirms that data is successfully committed
to the primary, also loses a large number of writes:

```
6000 total
5900 acknowledged
3692 survivors
2208 acknowledged writes lost! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
458 463 468 473 478 483 ... 3075 3080 3085 3090 3095 3100
0.98333335 ack rate
0.3742373 loss rate
0.0 unacknowledged but successful rate
```

Because the replication protocol is asynchronous, writes continued to succeed
against n1, even though n1 couldn't replicate those writes to the rest of the
cluster. When n3 was later elected primary in the majority component, it to
power with an *old* version of history--causally disconnected from those writes
on n1. The two evolved inconsistently for a time, before n1 realized it had to
step down.

When the partition healed, Mongo tried to determine which node was
authoritative. Of course, there *is* no authoritative node, because both
accepted writes during the partition. Instead, MongoDB tries to find the node
with the highest optime (a monotonic timestamp for each node's oplog).
Then it forces the older primary (n1) to roll back to the last common point
between the two, and re-applies n3's operations.

In a rollback, MongoDB dumps a snapshot of the current state of conflicting
objects to disk, in a BSON file. An operator could later attempt to reconstruct
the proper state of the document.

This system has several problems. First, there's a bug in the leader election
code: MongoDB may promote a node which does *not* have the highest optime in
the reachable set. Second, there's a bug in the rollback code. In my tests,
rollback *only worked roughly 10% of the time*. In almost every case, MongoDB
threw away the conflicting data altogether. Moreover, not all types of objects
will be fully logged during a rollback: capped collections, for instance, throw
away all conflicts *by design*. Third, even if these systems *do* work
correctly, the rollback log is not sufficient to recover linearizability.
Because the rollback version and the oplog do not share a well-defined causal
order, only order-free merge functions (e.g. CRDTs) can reconstruct the correct
state of the document in generality.

This lack of linearizability also applies to FSYNC_SAFE, JOURNAL_SAFE, and even
REPLICAS_SAFE, which ensures that writes are acknowledged by two replicas
before the request succeeds:

```
6000 total
5695 acknowledged
3768 survivors
1927 acknowledged writes lost! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
712 717 722 727 732 737 ... 2794 2799 2804 2809 2814 2819
0.94916666 ack rate
0.338367 loss rate
0.0 unacknowledged but successful rate
```

The only way to recover linearizability in MongoDB's model is by waiting for a
*quorum* of nodes to respond. However, WriteConcern.MAJORITY is *still*
inconsistent, dropping acknowledged writes and recovering failed writes.

```
6000 total
5700 acknowledged
5701 survivors
2 acknowledged writes lost! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
(596 598)
3 unacknowledged writes found! ヽ(´ー｀)ノ
(562 653 3818)
0.95 ack rate
1.754386E-4 loss rate
5.2631577E-4 unacknowledged but successful rate
```

Where UNSAFE, SAFE, and REPLICAS_SAFE can lose any or all writes made during a
partition, MAJORITY can only only lose writes which were *in flight* when the
partition started. When the primary steps down it signs off on all WriteConcern
requests, setting OK to TRUE on each reply regardless of whether the
WriteConcern was satisfied.

Moreover, MongoDB can emit any number of false negatives. In this trial, 3
unacknowledged writes were actually recovered in the final dataset. At least in
version 2.4.1 and earlier, there is no way to prevent data loss during
partition, at any consistency level.

If you need linearizability in MongoDB, use WriteConcern.MAJORITY. It won't
actually be consistent, but it dramatically reduces the window of write loss.

## Riak

As a Dynamo clone, Riak takes an AP approach to partition tolerance. Riak will
detect causally divergent histories--whether due to a partition or normal
concurrent writes--and present *all* diverging copies of an object to the
client, who must then choose how to merge them together.

The default merge function in Riak is last-write-wins. Each write includes a
timestamp, and merging values together is done by preserving *only* the version
with the highest timestamp. If clocks are perfectly synchronized, this ensures
Riak picks the most recent value.

Even in the absence of partitions and clock skew, causally concurrent writes
means that last-write-wins can cause successful writes to be silently dropped:

```
2000 total
2000 acknowledged
566 survivors
1434 acknowledged writes lost! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
1 2 3 4 6 8 ... 1990 1991 1992 1995 1996 1997
1.0 ack rate
0.717 loss rate
```

In this case, a healthy cluster lost 71% of operations--because when two
clients wrote to the value at roughly the same time, Riak simply picked the
write with the higher timestamp and ignored the others--which might have added
new numbers.

Often, people try to resolve this problem by adding a lock service to prevent
concurrent. Since locks *must* be linearizable, the CAP theorem tells us that
distributed lock systems cannot be fully available during a partition--but even
if they *were*, it wouldn't prevent write loss. Here's a Riak cluster with
R=W=QUORUM, where all clients perform their reads+writes atomically using a
mutex. When the partition occurs, Riak loses 91% of successful writes:

```
2000 total
1985 acknowledged
176 survivors
1815 acknowledged writes lost! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
85 90 95 100 105 106 ... 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999
6 unacknowledged writes found! ヽ(´ー｀)ノ
(203 204 218 234 262 277)
0.9925 ack rate
0.91435766 loss rate
0.00302267 unacknowledged but successful rate
```

In fact, LWW can cause *unbounded data loss*, including the loss of information
written *before* the partition occurred. This is possible because Dynamo (by
design) allows for sloppy quorums, where fallback vnodes on both sides of the
partition can satisfy R and W.

We can tell Riak to use a strict quorum using PR and PW--which succeeds only if
a quorum of the *original* vnodes acknowledges the operation. This can still
cause unbounded data loss if a partition occurs:

```
2000 total
1971 acknowledged
170 survivors
1807 acknowledged writes lost! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
86 91 95 96 100 101 ... 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999
6 unacknowledged writes found! ヽ(´ー｀)ノ
(193 208 219 237 249 252)
0.9855 ack rate
0.9167935 loss rate
0.00304414 unacknowledged but successful rate
```

Dynamo is designed to preserve writes as much as possible. Even though a node
might return "PW val unsatisfied" when it can't replicate to the primary vnodes
for a key, it may have been able to write to one primary vnode--or any number of
fallback vnodes. Those values will still be exchanged during read-repair,
considered as conflicts, and the timestamp used to discard the older
value--meaning all writes from one side of the cluster.

This means the minority component's "failed" writes can destroy all of the
majority component's successful writes.

It is possible to preserve data in an AP system by using CRDTs. If we use sets
as the data structure, with union as the merge function, we can preserve all
writes even in the face of arbitrary partitions:

```
2000 total
1948 acknowledged
2000 survivors
All 2000 writes succeeded. :-D
```

This is *not* linearizable consistency--and not all data structures can be
expressed as CRDTs. It also does not prevent false negatives--Riak can still
time out or report failures--but it does guarantee safe convergence for
acknowledged writes.

If you're using Riak, use CRDTs, or write as much of a merge function as you
can. There are only a few cases (e.g. immutable data) where LWW is appropriate;
avoid it everywhere else.

## Measure assumptions

We've seen that distributed systems can behave in unexpected ways under
partition--but the nature of that failure depends on many factors. The
probability of data loss and inconsistency depends on your application,
network, client topology, timing, the nature of the failure, and so on.
Instead of telling you to choose a particular database, I encourage you
to think carefully about the invariants you need, the risks you're willing to
accept, and to design your system accordingly.

A key part of building that design is *measuring* it. First, establish the
boundaries for the system--places where it interacts with the user, the
internet, or other services. Determine the guarantees which must hold at those
boundaries.

Then, write a program which makes requests of the system from just outside that
boundary, and measures the external consequences. Record whether HTTP requests
returned 200 or 503s, or the list of comments on a post at each point. While
running that program, cause a failure: kill a process, unmount a disk, or
firewall nodes away from one another.

Finally, compare logs to verify the system's guarantees. For instance, if
acknowledged chat messages should be delivered at least once to their
recipients, check to see whether the messages were *actually* delivered.

The results may be surprising; use them to investigate the system's design,
implementation, and dependencies. Consider designing the system to continuously
measure its critical safety guarantees, much like you instrument performance.

## Lessons

Even if you don't use MongoDB or Riak, there are some general lessons you can
take away from these examples.

First, clients are an important part of the distributed system, not objective
observers. Network errors mean "I don't know," not "It failed." Make the
difference between success, failure, and indeterminacy explicit in your code
and APIs. Consider extending consistency algorithms through the boundaries of
your systems: hand TCP clients ETags or vector clocks, or extend CRDTs to the
browser.

Even well-known algorithms like two-phase commit have some caveats, like false
negatives. SQL transactional consistency comes in several levels. If you use
the stronger consistency levels, remember that conflict handling is essential.

Certain problems are hard to solve well, like maintaining an authoritative
primary with failover. Consistency is a property of the data, not of the nodes.
Avoid systems which assume node state consensus implies data consistency.

Wall clocks are only useful for ensuring responsiveness in the face of
deadlock, and even then they're not a positive guarantee of correctness. In
these tests, all clocks were well-synchronized with NTP, and we still lost
data. Even worse things can happen if a clock gets out of sync, or a node
pauses for a while. Use logical clocks on your data. Distrust systems which
rely on the system time, unless you're running GPS or atomic clocks on your
nodes. Measure your clock skew anyway.

Where correctness matters, rely on techniques with a formal proof and review in
the literature. There's a huge gulf between theoretically correct algorithm and
live software--especially with respect to latency--but a buggy implementation of
a correct algorithm is typically better than a correct implementation of a
terrible algorithm. Bugs you can fix. Designs are much harder to re-evaluate.

Choose the right design for your problem space. Some parts of your architecture
demand strong consistency. Other parts can sacrifice linearizability while
remaining correct, as with CRDTs. Sometimes you can afford to lose data
entirely. There is often a tradeoff between performance and correctness:
think, experiment, and find out.

Restricting your system with particular rules can make it easier to attain
safety. Immutability is an incredibly useful property, and can be combined with
a mutable CP data store for powerful hybrid systems. Use idempotent operations
as much as possible: it enables all sorts of queuing and retry semantics. Go
one step further, if practical, and use full CRDTs.

Preventing write loss in databases like MongoDB requires a significant latency
tradeoff. It might be faster to just use Postgres. Sometimes buying more
reliable network and power infrastructure is cheaper than scaling out.
Sometimes not.

Distributed state is a difficult problem, but with a little work we can make
our systems significantly more reliable. For more on the consequences of
network partitions, including examples of production failures, see
