Welcome to Jecci on Docker
===========================

This container runs the Jecci tests in sub-containers.

You are currently in the base dir of the git repo for Jecci.
If you modify the core jecci library make sure you "lein install" it so other tests can access.

To run a test:
   cd etcd && lein run test --concurrency 10
EOF

cd /jecci
