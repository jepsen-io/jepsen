(ns yugabyte.single-key-acid
  "Given a single table of hash column primary key and one value column with
  (value of --concurrency divided by 2 and by # of nodes) independent rows,
  verify that concurrent reads, writes and read-modify-write (UPDATE IF) operations
  results in linearizable history.

  Here's the deal. Each group of 2N consequent worker threads allocated by --concurrency are assigned
  to a separate row key. Of these 2N workers, first N are performing writes/updates and
  the last N are reading current state. Worker groups (i.e. table rows) are completely independent.
  To illustrate this further, given --concurrency 20 and N = 5:
  - Workers  0 to  9 will be working with row #0
  - Workers 10 to 19 will be working with row #1
  - Workers 0 to 4 and 10 to 14 will be updating their respective rows
  - Workers 5 to 9 and 15 to 19 will be reading their respective rows"
