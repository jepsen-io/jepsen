This is a brief overview of the basic steps necessary to run jepsen on a set of machines/vms/containers:

1) You'll need 6 'machines' running ubuntu. 5 to run the server software, and 1 client machine.
2) You'll need java and maven installed
3) You'll need to install leiningen. To fetch out all the clojure and java dependencies just run 'lein deps'
4) You'll need to have ssh access to the 5 server machines
4a) You'll want passwordless key-based access, which means you'll need to setup ssh-agent and add an identity
4b) If your private ssh key is not located at ~/.ssh/id_rsa, you'll need to provide a path at the command line (see below)
5) The account will need to be able to sudo on the 5 server machines
6) The machines need to be resolvable via DNS or /etc/hosts

Jepsen takes a number command line parameters that may help with configuration:

 -n (--number)      | "number of elements to add"
 -r (--rate)        | "requests per second"
 -f (--failure)     | "failure mode"
 -X (--special)     | "additional app arguments (if supported)"
 -u (--username)    | "username to use for ssh"
 -p (--password)    | "password for sudo invocations"
 -k (--key_path)    | "path to private ssh key"
 -t (--port)        | "port to use if not using the default"

Example usage:

$ lein run zk -p "mypassword" -n 100
