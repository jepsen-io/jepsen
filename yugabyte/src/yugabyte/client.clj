  "Helper for defining CQL clients. Takes a class name, a string keyspace, a
  vector of state fields (as for defrecord), followed by protocols and
  functions, like defrecord. Appends two fields, `conn`, and `keyspace-created`
  to the state fields, which stores the cassandra client connection, provides
  default open! and close! functions, and passes the whole state to defrecord.

  Defines a constructor without conn or keyspace-created fields. Args are 1:1
  with your state fields.

    (->MyClient)

  Automatically creates keyspace during setup!, and ensures that keyspace is
  used on every conn thereafter. We do this because CQL assumes clients set the
  keyspace once, and we don't want to do multiple network trips to set the
  keyspace for every operation.

  Calls to setup! take a lock to prevent concurrent creation of tables, which
  hits a bug in Yugabyte.

  Example:

		(c/defclient CQLBank []

				(do-stuff-with conn))

			(invoke! [this test op]
        ...)
